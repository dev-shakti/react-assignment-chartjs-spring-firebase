# Project Report: Component Structure and State Management

## 1. Introduction
This project is a React application designed to showcase various features such as user authentication, dashboard visualizations, and a form. The purpose of this report is to outline the structure of components and the state management strategies used.

## 2. Component Structure

### a) Component Hierarchy
- **App Component**: Root component containing all routes.
- **MainLayout**: Contains the navigation and common layout for authenticated users.
- **DashboardPage**: Displays user data and charts.
- Other pages: CounterPage, UserFormPage, etc.

### b) Functional and Presentational Components
- Functional components like `CounterPage` handle the state and logic.
- Presentational components like `Button` only display UI elements.

## 3. State Management Choices

### a) Local State
- `useState` used for managing local state like form inputs and counters.

### b) Global State
- React's Context API is used for managing authentication status globally across the app.

## 4. Data Flow and Interaction
- Data flows from parent components to child components via props.
- Global state like authentication is managed using Context API.

## 5. Error Handling
- Errors are handled using `try/catch` blocks and error boundaries.

## 6. Conclusion
The app structure uses functional components and Context API for state management. Future improvements may include using Redux for complex state management.
